# Dino-Game-Bot

I have created a bot that plays the chrome dinosaur game without hitting any cactus and birds.
I have used the concept of image processing and grayscale image with the python pyautogui library to automate this game.

The logic of the code is that i am created a rectangle in the front of dino and i am checking the rgb value in the rectangle 
if the rgb value is the black or near black then there is a cactus then i am jumping the dino.

This logic fails to work when night occur in the game so please suggest some corrections in the logic.
